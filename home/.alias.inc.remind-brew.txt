  brew list -1 | while read cask; do echo -ne "\x1B[1;34m $cask \x1B[0m"; brew uses $cask --installed | awk '{printf(" %s ", $0)}'; echo ""; done
    List all formulas, along with which other fomula use it.
    Any formula not used is either an orphaned formula (can be deleted), or has been installed on purpose (keep it).
    It will hep to sort by number of usage:
      awk '{print NF,$0}' "$file" | sort -nr | cut -d' ' -f 2-

  brew rmtree formula
    Remove a formula and its unused dependencies.
    Installation is "brew tap beeftornado/rmtree"
