# dotfiles
This is my near real-time repos that contains my dotfiles, that I managed through [homeshick](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick).

Sepcifically tuned for OSX (Cygwin was tuned once, maybe I'll use it again in the future, but no more maintained...)

So, here are:

1. Bash dot files
1. [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/) LUA scripts (including JIRA & Confluence integration)
2. iTerm2 solarized theme
