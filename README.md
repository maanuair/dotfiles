# MaanuAir's dotfiles
This is my near real-time repos that contains my dotfiles, that I managed through [homeshick](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick).

Sepcifically tuned for OSX (Cygwin was used before, but I'm no longer using it, so consider it abandoned...)

So, here are some:

1. Bash dot files
1. [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/) LUA scripts (including JIRA & Confluence integration)
2. iTerm2 solarized theme
